Eloquent link to an uploaded file and manage storing this file in some cloud storage. :cloud:

# Why this?

My goal is to design a package to handle the file upload, link the model with the uploaded file and then store the file on the cloud. The url has customizable formatters to execute some logic when generating the url, but you can create your own. When creating the model or uploading the file to cloud storage, we are not free of errors, so the creation and upload are covered to register unexpected behaviours and rollback taks.

## Proposals

* The package will allow you to easy configurate the path map of your model url.
* Support for dynamic parameters.
* Support for dynamic code execution on when compiling the path.
* Support for relating an Eloquent model with a link preview.
* Support for receiving a file request class on controller action, and attaching it to a model.

Sounds nice? Let's develop this! :smile:

## Basic Usage

You will specify what type of data type to be uploaded and create the model from it. The preview will be auto generated based on url configuration.

```php

public function upload(ImageFilRequest $imageUploaded) {
    $image = \App\Image::createFromFileRequest($imageUploaded);
    $image->id; // 1
    $image->filename; // profile.jpg
    $image->preview; // https://your-cloud-storage.com/your/path/1/profile.jpg
}

```

# Getting Started

## Installing

You can install using composer:
```bash
$ composer require yanmarques/lincable
```

> *Note: For now the package is not configured with Laravel as we are in development process. All you can do is to test*.

The first step is to register the url for your model on `config/lincable.php`. By default, the url has dynamic parameters to allow you to execute some logic when generating the url. To specify a dynamic parameter we just type a colon on the start of the parameter and voilÃ¡ (see [parsers and formatters](#parsers-and-formatters)). For now, we can register the schema of how the url will be generated for the model. 

Suppose we have an `Image` model with an ID and filename attributes. We have configurated the url to change the `:id` and `:filename` to the same attributes value in model. 

```php

return [
    ...
    
   'urls' => [
        \App\Image::class => 'your/path/:id/:filename'
    ]
];

```

Now we create the controller to handle the upload. Laravel uses the containter dependency injection to auto resolve methods arguments, the controller method registered on route has this definition as well, then we can put the file request we want to receive from on controller method. 

```php

public function upload(ImageFilRequest $imageUploaded) {
    $image = \App\Image::createFromFileRequest($imageUploaded);
    $image->id; // 1
    $image->filename; // profile.jpg
    $image->preview; // https://your-cloud-storage.com/your/path/1/profile.jpg
}

```

The ```ImageFileRequest``` is the class to handle the file uploaded. It extends from the `FileRequest` abstract class that actually handles the validation and configuration on file. When the request with the file comes, we try to load the file from class name, in this case the file parameter would be `image`. The good thing about using the file request on controller method is that we define what kind of data we expect on upload. The only abstract method to implement is the `rules`, to validate the file. The `image` attribute on request must be validate the rules. See laravel [validations](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/validation#rule-mimes). But others methods are available to customize how to perform the uplaod. See [FileRequest](#filerequest).

```php

use Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\File;

class ImageFileRequest extends FileRequest
{
    public function rules(UploadedFile $file) 
    {
        return [
             'required|mimes:jpeg,bmp,png'
        ];
    }
    
    public function beforeSend(File $file)
    {
        // Make file operations before send it to storage.
    }
}

```
